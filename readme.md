## 2. Analytical Solution Architecture
The Second task was to create an Analytical Solution Architecture of an organization that is familiar to me.

For this task, I used Keynote as a tool to create the graphics, because it allows me to add and layer different shares, objects, text, and easily format/arrange/edit them in an intuitive interface for Mac users. Alternative to draw.io.

- Source Layer - the data source layer
- Storage Layer - the data storage layer 
- Business Layer - layer for business user to accessing the data
Here is my visualization:
